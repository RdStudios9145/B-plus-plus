# B++ lang

A basic programmning language (more like a glorified calculator that doesn't know what `1/2` is) developed in c++ with a sprinkle of c to get started with programming programming languages

The `dev` branch is updated most often, if ever. Probably wont even push to master. Have fun.

According to the US grading system, this language is better than c and c++.
