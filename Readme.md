# B++ lang

A basic programmning language (more like a glorified calculator that doesn't know what `1/2` is) developed in c++ with a sprinkle of c to get started with programming programming languages

The `dev` branch is updated most often, if ever. Probably wont even push to master. Have fun.

According to the US grading system, this language is better than c and c++.

Usually, including the exe that the program created is one of the worst git sins, but I left it in because it wont hurt and I want people who don't have the dependencies to be able to run it real ez

Also, the dependencies are make and g++. I think I use the mingw g++ compiler. If you have all the deps, then run `make` to make the .o files and the exe, then just run `bpp compile tests/first.bpp`
